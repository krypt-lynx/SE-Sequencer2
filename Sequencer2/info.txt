[Not very] simple replacement for bunch of timer blocks

Capabilities:
 - multiple scripts executed by one block 
 - simultaneous execution of multiple scripts
 - ability to start actions
 - ability to change properties
 - ability to run another programmable block
 - ability to change text on lcd screen
 - ability to send remote message 
 - wait for time period with sub second precision
 - transparent save/load handling


Installation:
 - Install Programmable block ("Sequencer")
 - Load Sequencer v2 script in "Sequencer"
 - Put your code into Custom Data of "Sequencer"
   - Every time then code changed you need to run "Sequencer" with "reset" or "parse" argument


Run Arguments
 start [method]
   start method named "method" if not started
 stop [method]
   stop method named "method" if started
 exec code
   parse and execute "code"
 parse 
   reload code from "CustomData" (respects existing variables and executing methods)
 reset 
   reset script state (forces state reset and script parsing)
 status
   outputs diagnostic information
 anything starting with "/" will considered as code and executed as "exec code"
 
 stuff inside [] is optional


Syntax:

 @method-name
 #comment
 /command argument "also argument" :third argument
 $tuple argument1 argument2 argument3 ...
 /command %tuple

Commands:

 /run [filter_type] programmable_blocks argument
 /action [filter_type] blocks action
 /set [filter_type] blocks property value
 /text [filter_type] text_panels [append] text
 /transmit [filter_type] antennas [target] value

 /wait seconds
 /waitticks ticks
 /repeat
 /start [method]
 /stop [method]
 /load [code]
 /unload [method]
 /setvar variable value
 /switch variable method1 method2 ...
