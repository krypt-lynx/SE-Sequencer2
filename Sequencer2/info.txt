[Not very] simple replacement for bunch of timer blocks

Capabilities:
 - multiple scripts executed by one block 
 - simultaneous execution of multiple scripts
 - ability to start actions

 - ability to change text on lcd screen
 - ability to send remote message 
 - wait for time period with sub second precision
 - transparent save/load handling


Installation:
 - Install Programmable block ("Sequencer")
 - Load Sequencer v2 script in "Sequencer"

   start method named "method" if not started
 stop [method]
   stop method named "method" if started
 exec code

 parse

 anything starting with "/" will considered as code and executed as "exec code"
 
 stuff inside [] is optional
